  1. when to use functions


Functions are really intended to be small blocks of code.  One very overlooked value of functions is to make small decisions and return True or False values to help make your conditional statements much easier to read.

We can use complex conditional statements using multiple *and* and *or* connectors, but we could also make them available in a function that returns a boolean value.

Consider the sample1.py program.

At other times, we might want to create a function that returns multiple return values!  Maybe you need an x-y coordinate, or even an x-y-z coordinate!

Open up sample2.py and see how it looks!

Assignment 1:
Create a function called **isNegative(float)** that takes a float parameter.  Return a boolean value to indicate whether the result is True or False

Assignment 2:
Create a function called "**isHappy(float)**.  This will return a boolean value that meets the following criteria:
* it is a number
* is an integer
* it is positive

Assignment 3:
Create a function called **isPerfectSquare(float)**.  This will return a True value if the number is a perfect square

Assignment 4:
Create a function called **isPythagoreanTriple(a,b,c)**.  This will return a True value if the 3 numbers form a pytyagorean triple.  Note that you will ahve to decide which number would be the hypotenuse
